[Simplify and empower npm scripts with p-s][video] 11:19

## The problem

Even though npm scripts have a ton of advantages ([learn more][scripts-advantages]), it can grow into an
[unmaintainable mess][mess] in your `package.json` file. Part of the problem is we're configuring scripts in `json`
which has fundamental issues (like no comments).

## This solution

`p-s` is a package that solves this problem by allowing you to move your scripts to a `package-scripts.js` file. Because
this file is a JavaScript file, you can do a lot more with your project scripts. Here's an example of a
`package-scripts.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    default: 'node index.js',
    lint: 'eslint .',
    test: {
      // learn more about Jest here: https://kcd.im/egghead-jest
      default: 'jest',
      watch: {
        script: 'jest --watch',
        description: 'run in the amazingly intelligent Jest watch mode'
      }
    },
    build: {
      default: 'webpack',
      prod: 'webpack -p',
    },
    validate: 'nps --parallel lint,test,build',
  },
}
```

Or in case you prefer YAML, here's an example of how that would look in a `package-scripts.yml` file:

```yml
scripts:
    default: node index.js
    lint: eslint .
    test:
        # learn more about Jest here: https://kcd.im/egghead-jest
        default: jest
        watch:
            script: jest --watch
            description: run in the amazingly intelligent Jest watch mode
    build:
        default: webpack
        prod: webpack -p
    validate: nps --parallel lint,test,build
```

To use `p-s`, it's recommended that you either install it globally (`npm i -g p-s`) or add `./node_modules/bin` to your
`$PATH` (be careful that you know what you're doing when doing this).

Then you can run:

```console
p-s --help
```

Which will output:

```console
  Usage: nps [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                                  output usage information
    -V, --version                               output the version number
    -s, --silent                                Silent nps output
    -p, --parallel <script-name1,script-name2>  Scripts to run in parallel (comma seprated)
    -c, --config <filepath>                     Config file to use (defaults to nearest package-scripts.yml or package-scripts.js)
    -l, --log-level <level>                     The log level to use (error, warn, info [default])
    -r, --require <module>                      Module to preload

Available scripts (camel or kebab case accepted)

lint - eslint .
test - jest
test.watch - run in the amazingly intelligent Jest watch mode - jest --watch
build - webpack
build.prod - webpack -p
validate - nps --parallel lint,test,build
```

**Because `p-s` is harder to type, it is recommended that you use the alias `nps` to interact with `p-s`, which is much
easier to type and the rest of the documentation will use `nps`**

Now, to run a script, you can run:

```console
nps lint
nps test.watch
# etc.
```

But the fun doesn't end there! You can use a prefix:

```console
nps b # will run the build script
```

And these prefixes can go as deep as you like!

```console
nps b.p # will run the production build script
```

Cool stuff right? And there's more on [the roadmap][roadmap].

**Also** check out the [examples][examples]. You'll find some good stuff in there (including how to deal with windows
and other cross-platform issues).

**Note:** If you don't like installing things globally and don't want to muck with your `$PATH` (or don't want to
require that your co-workers or project contributors to do so), then you can add a single script to your `package.json`.
We recommend that you use the `start` script because it requires less typing:

**package.json**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nps"
  }
}
```

You don't have to use the `start` script if you don't want. Note that if you're writing a node application, you're
likely using `nps` for starting your server. In that case, you can create a `default` script which will be run
when `nps` is run without arguments (so effectively it'll work just the same). But if you'd prefer, you can use whatever
you wish. For example you could easily create a `nps` script and do: `npm run nps b`.

## Installation

This module is distributed via [npm][npm] which is bundled with [node][node] and should
be installed as one of your project's `devDependencies`:

```
npm install --save-dev p-s
```

### global installation

You can install this module globally also (this is recommended):

```
npm install --global p-s
```

From here you can use `p-s` on the command line via one of the installed aliases: `nps` or `p-s`.

If you do this, you may also be interested in installing the shell autocompletion script. Do so by running:

```
nps completion <optionally-your-bash-profile-file>
```

The bash profile file defaults to `~/.bash_profile` for bash and `~/.zshrc` for zsh. Special thanks to the
[`omelette`][omelette] package for making this so easy.

## Getting started

If you're already using npm scripts, you can get up and going really quickly with the `init` command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/nps init
```
or
```
./node_modules/.bin/nps init --type yaml
```

This will use your `package.json` `scripts` to generate a `package-scripts.js` (respectively a `package-scripts.yml`)
file and update your `scripts` to utilize the `nps` binary.

## API

### CLI

#### Commands

##### help

If you have a `help` script, then your `help` script will be run. Otherwise, this will output the help.

> Note: you can do this with `nps --help`, but if you're using the `start` script in your `package.json` this allows you
> to run `npm start help` rather than `npm start -- --help`

##### init

As indicated above, this will migrate your npm scripts to package-scripts.

##### completion

Installs autocompletion functionality into your default bash or zsh configuration. You can override the default by
providing a specific file:

```console
nps completion ~/.bashrc
```

Note: you should probably only do this if you have the package installed globally. In that case you should probably also
normally use the `nps` alias rather than `p-s` because it's easier to type.

#### CLI options

##### -h, --help

Will print out the help you see above (the available scripts are colored 🌈 and come from the config specified/default
config).

##### -s, --silent

By default, `nps` will log out to the console before running the command. You can add `-s` to your command to silence
this.

##### -p, --parallel

Run the given scripts in parallel. This enables handy workflows like this:

```console
nps -p lint,build,cover && nps check-coverage && nps report-coverage
```

##### -c, --config

Use a different config

```
nps -c ./other/package-scripts.js lint
```

Normally, `nps` will look for a `package-scripts.js` file and load that to get the scripts. Generally you'll want to
have this at the root of your project (next to the `package.json`). But by specifying `-c` or `--config`, `nps` will
use that file instead.


##### -l, --log-level

Specify the log level to use

##### -r, --require

You can specify a module which will be loaded before the config file is loaded. This allows you to preload for example
babel-register so you can use all babel presets you like.

##### args

You can pass additional arguments to the script(s) that are being spawned:

```console
nps lint --fix # --fix will be passed on to the lint script
```

##### scripts

If you don't use `-p` (because you don't need parallelism) then you can simply provide the name of the script like so:

```console
nps cover
```

And you can run multiple scripts in series by providing a comma-separated list:

```console
nps cover,check-coverage
```

That's all for the CLI.

### package-scripts.js

`nps` expects to your `package-scripts.js` file to `module.exports` an object with the following properties:

#### scripts

This can be an object or a function that returns an object. See the annotated example below for what this object can
look like (and different ways to run them):

```javascript
module.exports = {
  scripts: {
    default: 'echo "This runs on `nps`"', // nps
    // you can assign a script property to a string
    simple: 'echo "this is easy"', // nps simple
    // you can specify whether some scripts should be excluded from the help list
    hidden: {
      script: 'debugging script',
      hiddenFromHelp: true,
    },
    test: {
      default: {
        script: 'jest', // nps test
        description: 'Run tests with jest',
        // your scripts will be run with node_modules/.bin in the PATH, so you can use locally installed packages.
        // this is done in a cross-platform way, so your scripts will work on Mac and Windows :)
        // NOTE: if you need to set environment variables, I recommend you check out the cross-env package, which works
        // great with p-s
      },
      otherStuff: {
        // this one can be executed two different ways:
        // 1. nps test.otherStuff
        // 2. nps test.other-stuff
        script: 'echo "testing other things"',
        description: 'this is a handy description',
      },
    },
    // this one can be executed a few different ways:
    // 1. nps k
    // 2. nps kebab-case
    // 3. nps kebabCase
    'kebab-case': 'echo "kebab-case"',
    series: 'nps simple,test,kebabCase', // runs these other scripts in series
  },
}
```

```console
nps k # runs nps kebab-case
```

#### options

This object is used to configure `nps` with the following options:

##### silent

Setting this to `true` will prevent `nps` from outputting anything for your script (normally you'll get simple output
indicating the command that's being executed). This effectively sets the `logLevel` to `disable`.

##### logLevel

This sets the logLevel of `nps`.

## ENV variables

### LOG_LEVEL

By setting `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable you can control the log level for `nps`

## Log level

Log levels available:

- `error` - errors only
- `warn` - errors and warnings only
- `info` - info, errors, and warnings (default)

## FAQ

### Why `npm start`?

_Just to be clear:_ You do **not** have to use the `start` script. You can use whatever you like. But I recommend using
the `start`. [npm scripts][npm scripts] are generally run with `npm run <script-name>`. There are some exceptions to
this. For example:

1. `npm run test` === `npm test` === `npm t`
2. `npm run start` === `nps`

So, while you could use a script called `script` and run `npm run script build`, I just think it reads more clearly to
just use the `start` script and run `nps build`. It's also nice that it's fewer things to type. You could also use
the `test` script and then type even less: `npm t build`, but thats just... odd.

Note, often servers are configured to run `npm start` by default to start the server. To allow for this case, you can
provide a `default` script at the root of your scripts which will be run when `npm start` is run without any arguments.
Effectively this will allow you to have a script run when `npm start` is executed.

## Inspiration

This was inspired by [a tweet][tweet] by [@sindresorhus][sindre].

## Other Solutions

- [scripty][scripty] has a solution for this problem as well. The reason I didn't go with that though is you still need
a line for every script (one of the pains I'm trying to solve) and a each script requires its own file (one of the
benefits of npm scripts I wanted to keep).

## In the wild

- [react-component-template](https://github.com/nkbt/react-component-template) uses `p-s` to implement shareable npm
scripts. See then how dependent [react-swap](https://github.com/nkbt/react-swap) can reuse them.

GOTCHAS:
  - use `process.cwd()` as the base for all paths

- [Hypercubed/EventsSpeedTests](https://github.com/Hypercubed/EventsSpeedTests) uses `p-s` to automate benchmark running
and reporting in node and the browser.  `package-scripts.js` enables us to keep our scripts DRY.  Combined with
[grunion](https://github.com/Hypercubed/grunion) allows benchmarks to be run, serially or concurrently, on glob
patterns.

- [SmithersAssistant/Smithers](https://github.com/SmithersAssistant/smithers) is an [electron](https://electron.atom.io)
based personal assistant. Smithers works on multiple platforms. Smithers uses `p-s` to dynamically find the current
platform and execute the dev environment. Now we don't have to manually update the `package.json` scripts when you are
on a different platform!
